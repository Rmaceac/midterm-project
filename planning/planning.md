# Food Delivery App (Feed Fone? ðŸ¤£)

## App Overview
A food ordering experience for a **single restaurant**. Hungry clients of this fictitious restaurant can visit its website, **select one or more dishes and place an order for pick-up**. They will **receive a notification** when their order is ready.

The **restaurant and client both need to be notified** since this app serves as an intermediary.

When an order is placed **the restaurant receives the order via SMS**. The restaurant can then **specify how long it will take to fulfill it**. Once they provide this information, the **website updates for the client and also notifies them via SMS**.

You can use a modern telecomm API service such as **Twilio** to implement SMS communication from the website to the client and restaurant.

For inspiration check out how Ritual works, but keep in mind that's implemented as a native app and serves more than one restaurant.
